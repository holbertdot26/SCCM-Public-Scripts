' AUTHOR: Robert Holbert Previously: Andrew Buford

'
' COMMENT: This script will detect if the current assigned value for the computer name 
' begins with MININT, indicating that this image is bare metal image.  It then prompts
' the end-user to enter a new computer name.
'
' VERSION : 1.1
' 1.0 (12/08/2008)- Intial script to check if the computer name begins with 
'  "minint", which indicates the system was booted with CD or PXE.
' 1.1 (06/01/2009)- Added check if the computer name equals "minwinpc", 
'  which indicates the system was booted with USB key
' 1.2 (09/26/2012)- Added restriction that computer name can't be over 13 characters
